Every now and then I forget to stop time tracking and can't remember when I left the office
(especially after weekends). So normally I just consult git logs via [git-standup][gs]. That works
pretty nice because you should always check in your stuff before you leave.

But as you may already guessing sometimes I manage to even forget about that, like today. To solve
the issue I assume that my last save of a source file relates roughly to when I left the office.

So I came up with this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git status -s | sed -nr 's/ M (.)/\1/p' | xargs stat -c %y
{% endhighlight %}

The `git status -s | sed -nr 's/ M (.)/\1/p'` part will return a list of files with uncommitted
changes. The following `xargs stat -c %y` prints modification time for each file.
